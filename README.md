This mod implements the [CBPaste Formatting Specification](https://gist.github.com/Lerycide/5a76891729fbbcf7a0de7521a2c0e093), by adding an option to export tapes into text format, or if via Debug Console, import pastes and generate tapes from them.

You can get the release and the rundown on [ModWorkshop](https://modworkshop.net/mod/49990).
